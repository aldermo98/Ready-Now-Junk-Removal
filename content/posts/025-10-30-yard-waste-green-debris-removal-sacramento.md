You trimmed the trees, cleaned the gutters, and raked until your arms gave up—  
now you’ve got a mountain of branches and bags staring at you.  

Sacramento’s weekly green-bin program only takes **so much**, and piling it on the curb isn’t always an option.  
Here’s how to handle your yard waste the smart, legal, and eco-friendly way.

## 🌲 1. Know What Counts as “Green Waste”

According to **Sacramento County Waste Management**, *green waste* includes:
- Grass clippings & leaves  
- Tree branches & brush  
- Shrubs, vines, & palm fronds  
- Untreated wood scraps  

**Not green waste:** dirt, rocks, sod, treated lumber, fencing, or concrete.  
(Yeah—those need a different dump stop. We can take them too.)

## 🧺 2. The DIY Drop-Off Option

If you don’t mind hauling it yourself, you can visit:
- **Kiefer Landfill (Elk Grove area)**  
- **North Area Recovery Station (Sacramento)**  

Fees are around **$15–$25 per truckload**, depending on weight.  
Bring gloves, straps, and patience.
