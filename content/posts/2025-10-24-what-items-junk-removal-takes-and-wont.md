# What Items Junk Removal Companies Take — and What They Won’t

Not sure what counts as “junk” vs “hazardous”? You’re not alone.  
Let’s clear up what we *can* load in the truck — and what needs special disposal.

---

## ✅ Items We Gladly Take

### Household Items
- Furniture (couches, tables, mattresses)
- Appliances (washers, dryers, stoves)
- Electronics (TVs, PCs, printers)
- Clothing, toys, and décor

### Outdoor Items
- Yard debris, fencing, and lumber
- Hot tubs, sheds, patio furniture

### Construction Debris
- Wood, drywall, carpet, tiles, and light concrete

## ⚠️ Items We Can’t Take
By California law, some materials need to go to specific disposal centers:

- Paint, oils, and solvents  
- Roofing tar or adhesives  
- Propane tanks, car batteries  
- Medical or biohazard waste  
- Asbestos-containing materials

But don’t stress — we’ll tell you *exactly* where to drop them. Sacramento County’s **Hazardous Waste Facility** handles most of it.

## ♻️ Where Your Junk Actually Goes

We don’t just dump and dash.  
We **recycle metal, cardboard, and e-waste**.  
We **donate furniture and electronics** that still work.  
We aim to **divert 60%+ of items from landfills** — because good junk deserves a second life.
