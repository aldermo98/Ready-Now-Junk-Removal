That old fridge humming in the garage? The washer that gave up mid-cycle?  
Appliances are greatâ€”until theyâ€™re heavy, awkward, and full of sharp corners.  
Hereâ€™s how Sacramento homeowners can ditch dead appliances **safely, legally, and without breaking the bank**.

---

## ðŸ§Š 1. Understand Californiaâ€™s Appliance Laws

California doesnâ€™t play around with refrigerants or electronics.  
Dumping appliances is illegal (and comes with fines up to **$1,000+**).  
They contain materialsâ€”freon, mercury, oilsâ€”that must be handled correctly.

Thatâ€™s why we haul them to **certified recycling centers** only.

## ðŸ”Œ 2. Common Appliances We Pick Up

- Refrigerators & freezers  
- Washers & dryers  
- Dishwashers  
- Stoves, ovens, microwaves  
- Water heaters  
- Window AC units & mini-splits  

If it plugs in or hums, weâ€™ll haul it.

## ðŸšš 3. How We Remove Them Safely

Our crew handles **disconnecting, lifting, and loading**â€”no wall dings, no scratched floors.  
We blanket-wrap heavy items and recycle all appliances at **Sacramento Recycling & Transfer Station** or **Sims Metal Management**.

We even remove doors from fridges (safety firstâ€”especially if kids are around).

## ðŸ§° 5. Donation & Reuse Options

If it still works, weâ€™ll donate it to:
- **Habitat for Humanity ReStore (Roseville / Rancho Cordova)**  
- **Goodwill Appliance Re-Use Program (Elk Grove)**  

We test and label working items before drop-off.

## ðŸ§  6. DIY Drop-Off (If You Really Want To)

If you insist on doing it yourself:
1. Drain any water or oil.  
2. Remove doors/lids.  
3. Transport upright if possible.  
4. Drop at **Kiefer Landfillâ€™s Appliance Recycling Area**.

Itâ€™s cheaperâ€”but itâ€™s also a workout. Weâ€™ll handle the sweat part if you prefer. ðŸ˜‰
