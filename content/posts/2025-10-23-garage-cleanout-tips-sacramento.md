# 7 Proven Garage Cleanout Tips for Sacramento Homeowners

If your garage looks like a thrift store and a landfill had a baby ‚Äî you‚Äôre not alone.  
Most Sacramento homeowners use the garage as their ‚Äútemporary‚Äù storage that somehow became *permanent*.  
Let‚Äôs fix that.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Empty It All Out

Pull everything onto the driveway. Seeing it all laid out helps you face reality (and maybe question some life choices üòÖ).

Make four piles:  
**Keep ‚Ä¢ Donate ‚Ä¢ Recycle ‚Ä¢ Junk**

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Call Your Local Junk Removal Crew

Skip the rented trailer. We‚Äôll swing by, load up the junk, recycle what we can, and you can watch your floor reappear.

A single truckload usually takes **under 1 hour**.  
We cover *Sacramento, Elk Grove, Roseville, and Folsom* ‚Äî and we donate usable items.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Organize What‚Äôs Left

Use clear bins, wall hooks, and shelves. Label everything.  
Keep seasonal gear high, daily tools low.

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Don‚Äôt Store These in the Garage
- Paint or propane tanks (fire hazard)  
- Food (rodent magnet)  
- Batteries or chemicals  

Those go to hazardous waste drop-offs ‚Äî we can point you to the right one.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Donate, Don‚Äôt Dump

Still-usable items go to **Habitat for Humanity**, **Goodwill**, or **local shelters**.  
Less waste, more good.

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Keep It Up (Maintenance = Magic)

Every few months, scan your garage. If you haven‚Äôt touched it since the Kings made playoffs‚Ä¶ time to toss it.

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Call the Pros When It‚Äôs Time

You‚Äôve got better things to do than play Tetris with old furniture.  
We‚Äôll haul it, recycle it, and make it disappear.
