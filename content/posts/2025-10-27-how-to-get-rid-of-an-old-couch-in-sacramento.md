# How to Get Rid of an Old Couch in Sacramento (Without Paying a Fortune)

You’ve stared at that sagging couch for months. Maybe it’s survived a few roommates, a spilled latte, and one too many game nights — but it’s time.  
The only question is: *how do you get rid of it without spending a fortune or breaking your back?*

Let’s talk about your options — and which one actually makes sense in Sacramento.

## 💸 Option 1: The “DIY Drop-Off” Route

If you’ve got a truck (or a buddy who does), you can haul it to a **Sacramento Transfer Station** or the **Kiefer Landfill**.  
Expect to pay **$15–$35** in dump fees depending on the load and material.

**Pros:**  
✅ Cheap if you already have a truck  
✅ Same-day disposal  

**Cons:**  
❌ Heavy lifting, long lines, and dump dust  
❌ You pay gas + disposal + time  

Unless you love wrestling furniture at the landfill, it’s usually not worth the headache.

## 🪑 Option 2: Donate or Rehome It

If your couch is still in decent shape, try:
- **Habitat for Humanity ReStore** (Sacramento & Roseville)  
- **Goodwill** or **SPCA Thrift Store** (Elk Grove & Citrus Heights)  
- **Facebook Marketplace / Nextdoor** — “Free Couch, You Haul”

Be honest about condition (no one wants mystery stains).  
Donation pickup slots can take days — so plan ahead.

## 🚚 Option 3: Call a Local Junk Removal Service

This is the stress-free route.  
At **Ready Now Junk Removal**, we pick up couches **same-day**, haul them, recycle what we can, and donate if it’s still usable.  
You point, we lift.

Average cost? **$100–$150** for a single couch — less than the chiropractor bill after trying to do it yourself.

## 🌎 How We Keep Couches Out of Landfills

We partner with local recyclers and donation centers so only truly unusable furniture gets dumped.  
If it can be cleaned, repurposed, or reused — it will be.

## 🧠 Quick Tip

Book a couch pickup *with other junk items* (old chairs, coffee tables, boxes).  
You’ll get a better per-load rate and one clean sweep.
