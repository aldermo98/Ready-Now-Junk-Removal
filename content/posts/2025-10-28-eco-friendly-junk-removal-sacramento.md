Sacramento’s growing fast, and with growth comes **junk** — couches, remodel debris, broken appliances, you name it.  
But tossing everything into a landfill isn’t the move.  
That’s why at **Ready Now Junk Removal**, we built our business around one idea:  
> *Keep Sacramento clean without trashing the planet.*

Here’s exactly how we make junk removal eco-friendly — and how you can too.

---

## ♻️ 1. We Sort Every Load — By Hand

When our crew loads your junk, we separate it on the spot:  
- **Metal & appliances** → recycled at local scrapyards  
- **Electronics** → dropped at certified e-waste facilities  
- **Furniture & décor** → donated if usable  
- **Cardboard & paper** → compacted for recycling  

Less than **40 %** of what we pick up actually ends up in a landfill.

## 🪑 2. We Partner With Sacramento Charities

That recliner that’s still got life left? It’s not “trash.”  
We donate to:
- **Habitat for Humanity ReStore** (Sacramento & Roseville)  
- **Goodwill Industries** (Elk Grove / Citrus Heights)  
- **Saint John’s Program for Real Change** — helping local families rebuild  

Every donation means one less item wasted and one more neighbor helped.

## 🔌 3. We Handle E-Waste the Right Way

Old TVs, computers, and monitors contain materials that need special care.  
We deliver e-waste directly to **CalRecycle-approved centers** so harmful components stay out of local soil and water.

---

## 🪵 4. Construction Debris? We Recycle That Too

Doing a remodel in Roseville or Folsom?  
We haul drywall, tile, and lumber to **Sacramento Recycling and Transfer Station**, where clean wood and concrete get reused in new builds.  
It’s full-circle construction.

---

## 💡 5. You Can Help Too

Before we arrive, you can make recycling easier:
- Keep **metal and cardboard** separate.  
- Set aside **donation-worthy items** (furniture, clothes, toys).  
- Let us know what you’d like us to try and donate first.

---

## 🌱 Why It Matters

California sends **millions of tons** of reusable material to landfills every year.  
By recycling and donating locally, we:
- Cut down CO₂ emissions  
- Support Sacramento charities  
- Keep dump fees (and your costs) lower  

So yeah — eco-friendly isn’t just good for the planet. It’s good for your wallet too.
