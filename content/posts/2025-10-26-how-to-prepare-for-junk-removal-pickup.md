So you booked your pickup — nice move. Here’s how to make sure your junk removal day goes perfectly (and fast).

---

## 1️⃣ Put Everything in One Spot
Garage, driveway, or curb — doesn’t matter, just make it accessible.  
The closer we can park, the faster (and cheaper) it goes.

---

## 2️⃣ Separate Donations
We love keeping good stuff out of the landfill.  
If it’s usable, we’ll donate it to Sacramento charities — just set those items aside.

---

## 3️⃣ Clear a Path
Move cars, toys, or obstacles. You’d be surprised what slows a crew down — extension cords and bikes are classic culprits.

---

## 4️⃣ Confirm Your Estimate
Text us pictures ahead of time for a fast, accurate quote.  
No surprises, no “we’ll see when we get there.”

---

## 5️⃣ Be Home or Leave Access
You don’t even have to be home — just leave clear instructions and payment method.  
We’ll text you before arrival and send pics after.

---

## ✅ Bonus Tips
- Tape or label items you’re keeping (“DON’T TAKE”)  
- Disconnect appliances beforehand  
- Keep pets inside (our team loves dogs, but safety first)
