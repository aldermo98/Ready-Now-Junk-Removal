Let’s be real — junk removal pricing can feel like a mystery. You Google *“junk removal near me”* and get quotes anywhere from **$99** to **$600**.  
What’s the deal? Let’s break down the *real* numbers, no fluff, no fine print.

## 💰 The Average Junk Removal Prices in Sacramento

| Load Size | Average Price | Example |
|------------|----------------|----------|
| 1/4 Truck | $100–$150 | Small piles, old furniture, or a single-room cleanup |
| 1/2 Truck | $200–$300 | Apartment move-outs or garage decluttering |
| 3/4 Truck | $350–$450 | Yard debris or multiple furniture pieces |
| Full Truck | $450–$650 | Whole-home cleanouts or remodel waste |

Each job is unique, but at **Ready Now Junk Removal**, we always charge by:
- **Truck capacity** (how much space your junk takes),
- **Actual dump fees** (we show you the receipts), and
- **Any special items** (appliances, heavy debris, etc.).

That’s it. No surprises.

## ⚙️ What Affects Your Junk Removal Cost

1. **Volume** – The more junk, the more space, the higher the cost.  
2. **Weight** – Dirt, concrete, roofing shingles, or soaked wood cost more to dump.  
3. **Accessibility** – Stairs, tight alleys, or long hauls = more labor.  
4. **Location** – We cover *Sacramento, Roseville, Elk Grove, Citrus Heights, Folsom,* and *Rancho Cordova*. Mileage’s included — no “zone fees.”  
5. **Special Handling** – Paint cans, tar, and chemicals need separate disposal (we’ll tell you up front).

## ♻️ How We Keep It Honest

We believe in **showing dump receipts**, **recycling metal and e-waste**, and **donating usable items**.  
That means less landfill waste and more value for you — and for Sacramento families who could use that gently used furniture you don’t need anymore.
